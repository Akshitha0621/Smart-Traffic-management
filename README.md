# Smart Traffic Management
## This repo contains simulation code of  Smart traffic management system

### 🚦 Intelligent Traffic Signal Simulation using Pygame

This is a Python-based simulation of a smart traffic signal system at a four-way intersection. It adjusts the green signal time dynamically based on vehicle density to optimize traffic flow.
